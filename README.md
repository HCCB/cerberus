Cerberus - HCCB Registration System
======
**Cerberus** is a prototype software system for the school's registration. 

This software aims to automate the registration of the school's registration.
Its primary goal is to make the registrar's office more efficient by handling
all the record keeping, and allowing fast searches of the students' records.

It will also help in scheduling the resources, such as the instructors, 
rooms, and the time slots.
