Cerberus - HCCB Registration System
======
**Cerberus** is a prototype software system for the school's registration. 

This software aims to automate the school's registration processes.

Its primary goal is to make the registrar's office more efficient by handling
all the routine record keeping, allowing fast searches of the students' 
records, and generate reports.

It may also help in scheduling the resources, such as the instructors, 
rooms, and the time slots.

This is a dynamic software will get more features when needed.
